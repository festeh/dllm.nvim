# dllm.nvim

Achtung! Work in progress.

A Neovim plugin for interaction with LLM providers. Heavily inspired by [gp.nvim](https://github.com/Robitx/gp.nvim)
that I really like! I decided to write my own plugin in order to use more providers.

# Features
* Chat with LLM 

# Supported providers
* OpenAI
* Anthropic

# Requirements
* Neovim >= 0.10.0
* curl
* plugin also installs [dllm](https://github.com/festeh/dllm) server
* API keys, of course
